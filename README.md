# News Site

This assignment was about building your own news site utilizing responsive design.

## The problem

I thought I knew how to approach this project at the start of the week, but later on it became more and more apparent that I hadn't understood certain things like I thought I had.
I had trouble getting the tablet view to work and to align everything in two columns using flexbox and grid on their own; in the end, I combined the two here and there, and
it finally worked okay. Going forward, I will manage things differently so that I don't end up so stressed with certain issues again.

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
